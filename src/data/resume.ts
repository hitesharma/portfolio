  summary: `I‚Äôm a developer who enjoys building systems that are efficient, reliable, and easy to reason about. I work mostly with Go, Node, and Python ‚Äî depending on what the problem calls for ‚Äî and care deeply about simplicity, clarity, and performance.

Whether it‚Äôs designing real-time systems, automating infrastructure, or building tools that scale, I like breaking down complex problems and solving them with thoughtful, maintainable code.

I believe good engineering is not just about what you build, but how well it fits the bigger picture ‚Äî the product, the team, and the users.`,
